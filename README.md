# JomSihat Website | INFO2302 WEBTECH PROJECT

This is a project for the web development course, INFO2302. JomSihat is a website all about Healthy Lifestyle. This is made in accordance with the rising cases of health and mental problems which have been a major issue for some time. It has become a phenomenon in developed and developing countries such as Malaysia. Due to this, we decided to take a stand against these problems by making a guideline platform-based web. This website is created to counter the problems by exposing and expanding people's views in the way of a healthy lifestyle. The focus will be on:
- Physical health
- Mental health
- Diet
- Spiritual health

We wanted people to be able to balance these aspects in order to achieve a healthy lifestyle which can be related to the 3rd **SDG: Good Health and Well-being**.
