      <p>
        Fasting is one of the sunnahs commonly practiced in Islam. Muslims fast
        one several occasions such as the month of Ramadhan, where fasting is an
        obligation for a month, twice a week which are recommended for Muslims
        and many others. This act of not eating for a certain period of time
        turns out to be good for our health. Fasting can:

          <br />
          <p>
            Several studies have found that fasting may improve blood sugar
            control, which could be especially useful for those at risk of
            diabetes. In fact, one study in 10 people with type 2 diabetes
            showed that short-term intermittent fasting significantly decreased
            blood sugar levels.

          <p>
            While acute inflammation is a normal immune process used to help
            fight off infections, chronic inflammation can have serious
            consequences for your health. Research shows that inflammation may
            be involved in the development of chronic conditions, such as heart
            disease, cancer and rheumatoid arthritis.

            Heart disease is considered the leading cause of death around the
            world, accounting for an estimated 31.5% of deaths globally.
            Switching up your diet and lifestyle is one of the most effective
            ways to reduce your risk of heart disease.

          <p>
            Though research is mostly limited to animal research, several
            studies have found that fasting could have a powerful effect on
            brain health. One study in mice showed that practicing intermittent
            fasting for 11 months improved both brain function and brain
            structure.

          <p>
            Many dieters pick up fasting looking for a quick and easy way to
            drop a few pounds. Theoretically, abstaining from all or certain
            foods and beverages should decrease your overall calorie intake,
            which could lead to increased weight loss over time.

          <p>
            Human growth hormone (HGH) is a type of protein hormone that is
            central to many aspects of your health. In fact, research shows that
            this key hormone is involved in growth, metabolism, weight loss and

            Several animal studies have found promising results on the potential
            lifespan-extending effects of fasting. In one study, rats that
            fasted every other day experienced a delayed rate of aging and lived
            83% longer than rats that didnâ€™t fast.

            Animal and test-tube studies indicate that fasting may benefit the
